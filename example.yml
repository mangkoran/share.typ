abstract: > 
  With `share.typ`, you can quickly create beautiful short writings to share in
  social media thanks to `typst.app` simple yet powerful syntax. Below are the
  steps to start creating awesome post using `share.typ`:
items:
- title: Add mangkoran/share.typ as git submodule
  description: >
    By adding `share.typ` repo as git submodule, any upstream changes can be
    pulled easily. You can modify several style variables and even override
    existing function implementations to your heart's content.
- title: Copy example files to repo root directory
  description: >
    Copy (and rename if you want) `example.typ` and `example.yml` to your repo
    root directory. For post YAML file you can create a new directory (`post`
    or else) for better organization. Don't forget to update the YAML import
    to reflect this. Use these files as template/starting point for your post.
- title: Compile content file
  description: >
    Typst compiles to PDF by default. To compile Typst to PNG, use `typst
    compile <your-post-content>.typ <output>.png`.
- title: Share in social media
  description: >
    Also let your followers know that the post was made using `typst.app`
    (and `share.typ`) 😁
